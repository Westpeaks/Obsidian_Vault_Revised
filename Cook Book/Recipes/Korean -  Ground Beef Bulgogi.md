## Ingredients

- **1 lb (450g) ground beef:** (preferably 90% lean)
    
- **1 tbsp oil:** (any neutral oil)
    
- **1/2 onion:** (finely chopped)
    
- **2 cloves garlic:** (minced)
    
- **4 tbsp soy sauce:** (adjust to taste)
  
- **2 tbsp of black or dark soy sauce:** (adjust for color and taste)
    
- **3 tbsp brown sugar:** (dark is better)
    
- **2 tbsp sweet rice wine (mirin):** (you can sub for rice vinegar)
    
- **1 tbsp sesame oil:** (adjust to taste)
    
- **1 tsp pepper:** (a little white and black)
    
- **1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds:** (optional, for garnish)
    
- **2 green onions:** (finely chopped, optional, for garnish)

## Directions

1. Mix all the bulgogi sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
    
2. Heat oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. When skillet is ripping hot, add ground beef. Smash ground beef down to cover the surface of the bottom of the wok. Leave until it has a good sear, then flip it and break apart with the spatula. Remove the meat and add a little extra oil if needed. 
   
3. Add onion and garlic, and cook until soft, about 1-2 minutes.
    
4. Add ground beef back to the wok.
    
5. Pour the sauce mixture over the beef and stir to combine. Turn the heat to high and allow the mixture to simmer until it is heated through and the sauce reduces, about 5 minutes. Most of the liquid should reduce and caramelize the beef.  Add sesame seeds in towards the end. 
    
6. Garnish with green onion and/ or cilantro, if desired. Serve immediately.
