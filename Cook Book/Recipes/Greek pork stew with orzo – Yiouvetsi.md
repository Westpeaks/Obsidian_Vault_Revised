### Ingredients

- 1 kilo pork neck
- 300 g orzo pasta
- 6-7 tablespoon(s) olive oil
- 1  onion
- 2 clove(s) of garlic
- 2 pinches granulated sugar
- 1 heaping tablespoon(s) tomato paste
- 400 g grated tomatoes
- 800 g water
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 stick(s) cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon(s) oregano
-   salt
-   pepper
-   parsley
- 50 g gruyere cheese
-   pepper

### Instructions

- Place a pot over high heat and let it heat up well.  
- Cut the pork into big pieces. 
- Put 3 tablespoons of olive oil in the pot, add the pork, and stir with a serving spoon to spread the meat pieces over the pot. 
- Season with salt and pepper, and sauté the pork for 6-7 minutes until nicely browned on all sides. 
- Finely chop the onion and garlic, add them to the pot, and mix well. 
- Add the sugar and tomato paste, and mix again.
- Add the grated tomatoes, water, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick, and stir well. 
- Put the lid on the pot, lower the heat completely, and simmer the stew for 40-50 minutes. 
- Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) set to fan. 
- Place a frying pan over high heat and add 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil and the orzo pasta. 
- Mix and sauté the orzo for 2 minutes until golden. (You need to do this to create a crust around the orzo and prevent it from becoming mushy.)
- Remove the pot with the stew from the heat and add the oregano. 
- Remove the pan from the heat, add the orzo to the pot, and mix well. 
- Transfer the stew to a 25x35 cm baking dish, and spread it well.  
- Put the baking dish in the oven and bake the yiouvetsi for 25-30 minutes. 
- Remove the yiouvetsi from the oven and serve it with parsley, gruyere cheese, and freshly ground pepper.
