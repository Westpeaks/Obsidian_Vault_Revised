### Ingredients

Serves 8

- 1 pound giant butter or lima beans, soaked in water overnight (these beans can also be substituted with 14oz of chickpeas)
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- 1 (28 ounce can) tomatoes pureed in blender
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 2 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley for garnish
- about 1 cup or more of crumbled feta cheese

### Instructions
- If using chickpeas, the next two steps can be negated.
- Soak the beans in a large bowl filled with cold water. Drain the water in the morning.
- Place beans in a large pot covered with cold salted water and bring to a boil. Cook the beans about 40 minutes or until tender but not mushy. They will continue cooking in the oven. Strain the beans and place them in a 9x13inch baking dish. Drizzle some olive oil on top and season with salt.
- Preheat the oven to 400 °F, 200 °C.
- Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a saucepan. Add onions and cook over medium-low heat until soft and golden. About 10-15 minutes. Add garlic and warm through until fragrant. Add tomato puree, spices and sugar.
- Bring to a boil and cook the sauce for 3-5 minutes. Pour the sauce over the beans and mix well. Bake uncovered for about 45 minutes.
- Remove the pan from the oven and top with crumbled feta cheese. Tuck the feta into the sauce and return to the oven to bake for 10 more minutes.
- If the sauce has completely been absorbed into the beans add some hot water (about a cup) and mix together.
- Top with fresh parsley and serve with olives and salad.
- Kali Orexi!
