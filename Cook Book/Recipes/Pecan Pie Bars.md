### Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
- 12 Tbsp unsalted butter (cold, diced)
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar (packed)
- 1/2 cup honey
- 12 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 1/2 cups coarsely chopped pecans (14 oz)

### Instructions

#### To Make the Crust:
- Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Line a 9x13 baking pan with foil or parchment paper (leave some paper hanging over the sides of the pan for an easier lift later. Spray with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.
- In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together the flour, powdered sugar, and salt and pulse a couple of times to combine. Add diced cold butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal with some pea-sized pieces forming. Transfer the mixture to your prepared pan, pressing the crust evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake at 350˚F for 18-20 minutes or until the crust has set and the edges are just lightly browned. Remove from the oven and set aside while you finish the filling.
#### Make the Pecan Pie Bars:
- In a large saucepan, combine the brown sugar, honey, butter, cream and salt. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and pecans, mixing until incorporated.
- Pour hot pecan filling over your warm crust. Return to the oven and bake for another 20-25 minutes until the top is bubbling and turns caramel color. Set the baking pan on a wire rack and cool completely to room temperature before cutting.
- Once the pecan squares are at room temperature, loosen the edges if needed and use the parchment paper or foil to lift the bars out of the pan. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 2-inch squares. Serve at room temperature.
