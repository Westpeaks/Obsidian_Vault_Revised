"The Christian Truth of the oneness of God is deepened by the truth of the *Tri-hypostatical unity*." - Pomazansky

There are many Christians whom profess the worship of Christ, of which the honor and attention given to the sacrifice of Christ on the cross is so emphasized that it can in turn diminish the Trinity. This is because the center of such compulsion resides in the assurance of salvation and the fact when they die, they will be in heaven. 

The fundamental honor, focus, and worship of God within the historical Church is the worship of the Trinity, and thus in no way diminishes the worship and honor given to Jesus Christ, our Lord. God is a perfect community within himself. Although aspects of God are entirely unknowable, God has chosen to reflect himself in his creatures. He not only honors the person through theosis, but he also in turn reflects and embues the perfect community  of great cloud of witnesses, his saints, with his energies. 

The veil has been torn and those on earth and in heaven participate and share in the perfect reflection of the community of the Trinity.
