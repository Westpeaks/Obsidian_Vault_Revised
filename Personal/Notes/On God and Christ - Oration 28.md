## Section 8

- God fills the universe. He cannot break this filling and holding together to inhabit a body unless he can contain both at the same time. Here St. Gregory makes the case that he must inhabit at least two hypostasis. 

- He also cannot simply be the fifth element as it were. For He is the creator and not constrained by his own creation. Nothing moves on God. He is the ultimate mover and source. 
- He does not contain an incorporeal body such as the angels, for he is much greater than the angels. "**How far will God transcend angels who are his ministers?**"
