**By Tito Colliander**

"For the wind it was a matter of indifference whether it was used or not. But for the sailor it was a means to reach his destination sooner. Thus you should think of obedience, and all the means that are offered us by the Holy Trinity, in that way."

It is by obedience that we obtain a godly life and salvation. Not just in obedience to God, but practicing obedience through opportunity given each day. This is the means by which we reach our destination, which is God.
