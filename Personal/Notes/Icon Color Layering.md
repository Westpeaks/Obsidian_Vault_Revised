## Traditional Byzantine style Face and Hands Color Layering

**Próplasma** (Base) - Yellow ochre, white, black, iron-oxide red

**Anōgē** (Facial Lines) - Próplasma mixed with a little black and iron-oxide red

**Sárx** (First Light) - 3 part Yellow ochre, 2-3 part titanium white, and a dab of cadmium red - middle consistency but on the thinner side. It is important not to add too much read as it makes the mixture too pink.
