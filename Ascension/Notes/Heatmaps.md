## Heat Maps within GRC

Heat maps within GRC typically focus on visualizing risk, findings, and remediation needs. They will usually follow two points of data follow by a third that provide quantitative measurement.
- Y-axis data point
- X-axis data point
- Summary data that provides quantity.
### Risk Heat Map

A risk heat map will typically track and identity the number of cases that are at a state of high to low risk and uses the following points:
- Y-axis is likelihood of occurrance.
- X-axis is measured by impact. 
- Summary data will typically be number of risk cases. 

### Findings Heat Map

A findings heat map might plot identified issues or audit findings based on:
- Severity of the finding on one axis
- Frequency or prevalence of the issue on the other axis

Colors could indicate:
- Green: Minor or isolated findings
- Yellow: Moderate or recurring issues
- Red: Critical or systemic problems

### Remediation Heat Map

A remediation heat map could visualize the status of mitigation efforts:
- Urgency of remediation on one axis
- Progress or effectiveness of remediation on the other

Color coding might represent:
- Green: Completed or low-priority remediation
- Yellow: In-progress or moderately urgent remediation
- Red: Not started or critically urgent remediation
