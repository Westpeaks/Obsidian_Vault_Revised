## Time Sheet Navigation

### Left Side Panel

Task cards are what you will select to fill out time. 

### Right Side Panel

The right panel contains the following:

- Week Selector
- Time Sheet State
- Logged Time Cards
- Graphs of current logged hours
- Action button to submit time

### Entering Project Time 

Enter your time in up to 15 minute increments.

#### Why it matters:

Approved project time feeds into project financials. 

The Finance team uses submitted and approved tiem to manage monthly project costs and reporting. 

### Entering Non-Project Time 

#### Non-Project time is the following:

- System maintenance
- Enhancements and requests - Documenting complex or structured work that doesn't have a formal ServiceNow project record.
- Participating in the change process
- Researching or solutioning technology ideas - Time spent pre-project to define scope and solution for a project. 
- Personal development - Time spent on training, education, or development activities. 
- Run the business - The most common non-project category. Operational work that doesn't fall under another specific card.
- Taking time off

Adding non-project time is the same as project time. You will select a non-project card.
