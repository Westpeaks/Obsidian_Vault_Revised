## Inter-Process Relationships

### Problem Management

Problem management is to prevent incidents from happening in the first place. 

- Reactive management is when you are reacting to an incident. You are to efficeiently identify and resolve underlying causes after they have occurred. This is the post reflection to prevent the incident from happening again.

- Both these methods use incident data, historic records, and incident management reports to provide vital information to investigation and proactive management.
