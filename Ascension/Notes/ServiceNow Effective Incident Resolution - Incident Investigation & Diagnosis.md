## Incident Investigation & Diagnosis

### This phase focuses on:

- Gathering detailed information
- Analyze symptoms
- Identify solutions and workarounds

### Adding additional CIs

As a resolver, you may be resposible for adding additional CIs during investigation.

#### To add Cis:

- Select **Affected CIs** 
- The **Add Affected CIs** dialog box displays. 
- Search for the ones you want to add and then select the approppriate **Add** button. There will be several options. 

### Outage records

When unplanned downtime occurs, an outage recordd must be created for documentation. When an outage occurs, it must be assessed as to whether it constitutes as a major incident.

- Outage records can be created from an incident record. They will then appear in the **Outages** tab.
- Outage records can be closed by entering a date in the **End** field and selecting "End Outage". 

### Researching solutions

As part of investigating, leveraging existing data within SNow can be used to resolve an issue. 

#### Use the platform to:

- Browse other incidents
- Review related problem records (search knowledge base)
- Check relevant change records (the issue could be resolving during investigation)

### Parent-Child relationships

Incidents could be related and link via parent-child relationships.

Child incidents will be automatically updated if the parent record is marked as resolved.

### Pausing and resuming an investigation

Incidents can be paused by placing the incident's **State** to "On Hold".

#### Reasons for On Hold status:

- awaiting caller (user related issue, must provide mandatory comments)
- awaiting change (resolution related)
- awaiting problem (awaiting the resolution of other incidents)
- awaiting vendor

### Related Search Results
