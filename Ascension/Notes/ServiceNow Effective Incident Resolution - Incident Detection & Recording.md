## Incident Detection & Recording
### Incident recording is handled in three ways:

- **Support Members**
- **End Users**
- **Automation** from the SNow platform alerts and monitoring

To record an incident, creat a new incident record or locate an existing created from the three methods listed above.

### Steps include:

- Create Incident record in SNow.
- Classify the incident and provide support
- categorize and prioritize the incident
- assign the incident

An incident can be categorized as a "break-fix" scenario.

### 1. Criteria for an incident:

- uplanned disruption
- not a service request
- requires immediate resolution

### 2. Create the incident:

- a brief summary 
- detailed description
- list impacted service and configuration item

There are three ways to do this. From thee navigation tabs, from a list, and from MyTechnology (select Get Help).

Fill out the Incident Form.

### 3. Categorize the incident

Assigning a category and subcategory helps to provide clarity and resolve the issue. Category indicates the type of incident. Subcategory further defines the type.

### 4. Incident prioritization

**Priority** is determined based on impact and and urgency. These are selectable by the ticket creator. 

#### Urgency Parameters

- Workaround
- VIP Users Impacted
- Environment of affected CI
- User functionality
- Number of affected users

#### Impact Parameters

- Application, service, site criticality importance
- Nature of event
- Impact on hospitals
- Patient care impact
- Saftey, reputation, or community impact

Priority can be changed in rare and certain cases.

### Major Incident Management

When an incident has exceptional impact or urgency, the **Major Incident Bridge** (MIB) process is activated. 

Common examples of a MIB qualification:

- Network outage of an entire location
- Complete failure of a critical tool
- Widespread virus or malware attack

### 5. Incident Assignment & Acceptance

This step marks assignment and acceptance to the parties responsible for resolution (resolver groups).

#### How to find an incident assigned to you:

- Navigating to Incident> Assigned to me
- Service Desk> My Work
- You can also filter based on task type or assignment group. 

#### Tasks 

Once assigned you will be given tasks. Complete the tasks to contribute to resolving the issue. An incident record will be created to track all related tasks.
