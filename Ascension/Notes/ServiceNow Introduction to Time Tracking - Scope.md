## Scope 

If you do project and non-project work and are part of a resource group (That is me), then you are in scope for tracking time in SNow.

**This includes:**

- Ascension Technologies Associates
- Extended partners and contingent workers (contract)
- All members of a resource group

**Groups that do not need to track time:**

- Administrative assistants
- Director-level and above (some still do)
- Associates From:
	- The Foundry
	- The Resource Group
	- LabCorp

### Kronos vs SNow

- Kronos = Getting Paid
- ServiceNow = What you worked on
