# PayIt Interview Cheat Sheet

## Tell me about yourself:

- I'm an accomplished Support Manager with over 8 years of experience leading and managing support teams. I hold myself to a very high standard in delivering customer service and support. This was established at the first tech company I worked for Onspring and has continued. I have a strong foundation in communication coming from my degree in English. This was further bolstered by three years as a teacher and writing coach. 

- I currently work as a Support Manager and Junior Site Reliability Engineer at Illuminate, I've established a support department, implementing core documentation, procedures, and data-driven KPIs from the ground up. 

- This has given me experience in building and leading high-performing teams. This included the development of a program working with the data science team. I developed KPIs, worked with them on tracking data, and refined support processes based on that data. I've also led the transition to a new ticketing system, Jira Support Desk.  

- My time at Zoom Communications as a Technical Support Engineer provided both a unique experience and gave me grit and maturity as a support engineer. It truly prepared me for every support situation. 
  
- I handled very complex customer issues and escalations, particularly in API integrations and developer support. I was third-tier support and was heavily involved in mentoring and training support engineers.
   
- I am very familiar with working in a tiered process, assisting engineers at lower tiers, handling escalations, and navigating a larger corporate landscape and processes. 

- These are all skills I would be excited to bring with me at PayIt. This aligns well with PayIt's focus on efficiency and scaling support operations.

- My background in creating documentation, training materials, and knowledge bases will be beneficial in developing self-service resources for PayIt's customers. Additionally, my experience in working with cross-functional teams to improve customer experience and drive business results makes me well-suited to collaborate effectively across PayIt's organization.

- I appreciate PayIt's mission of improving government service delivery and its culture of innovation and teamwork. I have wanted to break into the govtech space for quite some time. My technical proficiency, leadership experience, and passion for customer support make me an excellent fit for this role. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to PayIt's ambitious scaling goals.

## Management and Support Principles

- Customer service is about doing the best job you can do to provide assistance and make the customer happy. It is about an individual interaction. B2B support is about finding key points of contact and working with them to make the business as a whole happy and satisfied with the service you provide. These issues and relationships tend to be more complex. 
  
  I have done both in multiple roles, everything from a grandmother who doesn't know how to use a search bar to assisting IT teams in complex technical challenges and emergencies.  

## Practice Questions - Manager

#### 1. How do you stay organized and how do you organize a team? 

- The most important thing you can do is block your schedule and remain vigilant and organized. My day is always scheduled in blocks. For instance, my morning is almost always blocked for ticket time. An hour before big meetings is usually blocked for prep. Lastly, projects are blocked for the last 1-2 hours of the day. This applies to the engineers I train. 

#### 2. How do you handle high-pressure situations or a demanding workload without feeling overwhelmed? Share how your approach and mindset help you stay focused and maintain a positive outlook.

- I remember to stay organized and keep to the fundamentals. Great progress is made one step at a time. It is always important to step back and see a situation for what it really is. Then, you can objectively make the best choice or figure out what the best plan is. How I maintain a positive outlook is to remember what I am thankful for and to practice contentment. Thankfulness, mindfulness, and contentment are principles I live by.  

#### 3. What strategies do you use to motivate and develop your team? 

- First and foremost, I would say that team members should be self-motivated. As a manager, I have to establish a level of professionalism in how we conduct support and what attitude we have towards the customers we serve. Team members will be motivated by having a good team and a great place to work. Pay and benefits are also factors, but those are beyond my control. 
  
  I endeavor to foster great team camaraderie and mutual group practices in resolving issues. Engineers need to feel supported and that you have their best interests in mind. This is done through support (E.g., mentorship, proper documentation, proper policies and expectations, and proper procedures for escalations). They need to feel that they are not on their own.

#### 4. How do you measure the success of your support team?

- KPIs, personal growth, and achievement. First, are we meeting the KPIs and are the KPIs achievable? If we are not meeting those KPIs, then the engineer needs those support structures that are going to help them succeed. Once we are meeting KPIs, then I would say building skills and specialization. One measure of success I have found in larger organizations is, are other teams looking to us as a measure of success?
- Lastly, I would say good rapport among the team and with others. Is the team happy? Do they enjoy their work? 

#### 5. How would you approach improving customer satisfaction for residents using digital government services?

- I would listen to the customers and develop a customer-centric model for feature development. I would keep open communication with the development team to let them know what the customer's largest pain points are and what feature they want the most. I would provide them when necessary, insight on how our customers use the software and a customer perspective on features. 
- Outside of this, I would endeavor to offer the best support for the product that I could possibly provide. That includes communication, effective issue resolution, and proper documentation. Customers should be happy with the service they are receiving. Everyone should know they are receiving good support. 

#### 6. Can you give an example of how you've used data to improve customer support operations?

- I did this at Illuminate through the data-driven strategies that we implemented and the CSIT and CLW projects.

#### 7. What challenges do you foresee in managing support for digital government services, and how would you address them?

- We can not always predict technological challenges like access to technology etc., but what I have seen be a success in this type of issue is starting with an intuitive user experience. After that, it becomes a matter of readily offering all available methods of contact for support. for instance, Older people I have assisted prefer calling or meetings. Documentation is key as part of this. Lastly, properly trained engineers that can convey product expertise. 

#### 8. How do you ensure effective communication between your support team and other departments?

- Open communication channels are essential. Teams should be talking to each other and working together. Establishing that as a baseline is fundamental. After that, I would time wasting is extremely important. In ticket escalation, everything within the engineer's power of troubleshooting should be done before escalating to another department.  Also, it sounds silly, but being as pleasant as possible and easy to work with. People should speak well of you. 

#### 9. Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict within your team. What was the outcome?

- Ticket resolution times issue and response time issue. Developed new processes and metrics. 
- Generally, listen to both sides with equity. See if mutual acceptance and forgiveness can be achieved, and foster a team mentality. We are in this together working for a greater cause. 

#### 10. What is your approach to providing feedback to team members, especially those who are underperforming?

- Show the data. They need to see the standard that they are trying to meet. 
- As far as discussing areas for improvement, I use the padding method or sandwich method. 
- I ask them what they think they can do to meet the goals. I then offer mentorship and coaching where I see necessary and provide support for them until the next review. This is usually in the form of one-on-one ticket reviews or open ticket time meetings.
