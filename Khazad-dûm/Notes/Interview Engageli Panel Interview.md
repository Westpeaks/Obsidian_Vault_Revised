## Story Toolbox

### De-escalated customer 

I would often get rough callers and tickets at Zoom who by the time they got to me were extremely frustrated. I would establish technological proficiency with them, empathize with them and their frustration, and then work to resolve their issue while building trust.  

This can be with an org or an individual. I have brought a couple of accounts back from the brink at my current job. 

a. customers want someone who knows what they are doing. They want someone who knows how to find answers. 
b. It is important to reach out with the right information and questions. Think before you act, especially when you are asking via email. 

### Remote Working Value

I truly learned the value of online learning and working during my time at Zoom. The relationships I built there were some of the strongest I have had in my professional career. It also makes collaboration at work easy and strong. My team there became extremely proficient and had a great camaraderie, even though we had never met each other. Being on a good team is about helping each other grow. Everyone has something to offer. 

### Difficult time when working with others

There have been difficult times when working with others. I have been caught (more than once) in the middle of two coworkers at odds with each other. In each situation, I have tried to mitigate between the two. A fair and level head can often de-escalate a situation. The job you do is bigger than your personal feelings. You have to remember that you are a professional and need to perform as such. 

### Difficult time when working with a boss

My boss implemented an escalation process on issues that went to engineers. Instead of being able to go to the engineer that I needed to go to to resolve an issue, I had to submit to an engineer who would then escalate it as needed. This created unnecessary steps and lengthened the time it took for tickets to be resolved. Eventually, I recommended a daily support standup. Engineers relevant to issues could join and it allowed for the effective assignment and discussion of issues. This process ended up working best for everyone. 

12 tips:
1. **What is your greatest strength?** Empathy and Adaptability
2. **What are the biggest challenges in Support for this company?** I would say organization. I have done this at Illuminate. Created a support department. I need to be a solution.
3. How can I be a solution to their problems? My broad experience can do this. I have had a unique experience in support. I have spent years troubleshooting and resolving issues related to video conferencing solutions. 
4. Make the interview about them. What is Engageli doing that excites you? Wanting to be the best in space makes me want to work at Engageli. I also really enjoy working with video conferencing. The team seems great. Both people I have interviewed with seem to be amazing people to work with/for. I thrive in a good team environment. 
5. Ask them questions that show you understand them. How are they wanting to scale? What are they doing to keep a competitive edge? What are they wanting from support in the next 12 months? 
6. Share with them why you want the job. This job aligns with my background in education. I became a teacher to help people. Video conferencing helps people connect. Engageli democratizes education. I believe that is important. 
7. Mirror body language. Match their talk speed.
8. Be humble.
9. **Why are you leaving your current job?** Lack of opportunity. I took the job because they sold it as a great management opportunity. They stated they were rapidly growing and I would be working with a team under me before long. It hasn't worked out that way. I was depending on the job scaling up. I love the people I work with and I have learned a lot from the challenges but there isn't enough opportunity for me to consider staying long term and I don't believe it is a good fit for me.
10. **What am I looking for?** I'm looking for a company that is growing and is being successful in their space. I want to work at a company that I can make a difference at. I would like good opportunities to grow. Long term I would like to move towards a Cloud Engineering / Devops role. Startups can provide great opportunities to train cross-department and maybe even eventually transition. Opportunities to mentor and contribute. 
11. Give clear and concise answers. 
12. Remember past experiences.
