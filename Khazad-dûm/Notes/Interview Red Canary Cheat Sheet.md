# Interview Red Canary Cheat Sheet

## Tell me about yourself

I'm an accomplished Support Engineer and Manager with over 8 years of experience in the SaaS and web application domains. Within the support domain, I have l leaned into its more technical aspects and delivered exceptional customer service at a high standard. 

In my current role as a Support Manager and Junior Site Reliability Engineer at Softek Illuminate, I've been instrumental in improving our support operations. I've increased developer productivity and raised our CSAT rating. I have been responsible for building the support department from the ground up and implementing data-driven strategies. Automation has been a key focus in the development of these support practices within the organization.  

Previously, at Zoom, my key points that would relate to this position would be my experience working in the Zoom app marketplace, where I supported hundreds of application integrations with the Zoom communications platform. Handling sensitive tickets and information in a secure fashion such as data in transit, PHI and PII, security incidents, and individual and larger threats. This included meetings and accounts that were hijacked. I also played a key role in developer support, troubleshooting code, and integration configurations for major clients.

My experience at Onspring Technologies allowed me to work closely with QA, UX/UI, and Product teams, contributing to product development and quality assurance. I also handled a lot of data security issues there as one of the main solutions of the product was risk and compliance. I developed API integrations and a Python API library, showcasing my technical skills. I also provided support for a scripting engine that received JavaScript as an input. This was essentially an automation scripting engine. 

I'm proficient in Python, JavaScript, REST APIs, SSO, and SQL. I have experience in system and database management, including work with PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Linux environments. 

I have a strong technical ability, a propensity for continuous learning, and a broad and unique experience in supporting clients from all over the world. 

#### 1. What's your experience with troubleshooting complex technical issues?

- Talk about the complex data issues at sites while working at Illuminate. (app not launching)
	- Requires site health check. I'm looking into the logs of multiple applications, including containerized applications. I'm also looking at server resource constraints and services and the registry. I'm looking into database records to analyze what is sent to our system. Proactive monitoring also plays an integral role.
- Highlight your approach to problem-solving. 
	- Methodical 
	- Proactive through monitoring (checklists, documentation)
	- As automated as I can make it.

#### 2. Are you familiar with Red Canary's tech stack and tools? 

I have looked into Red Canary and what they do. The company is essentially an SaaS based MDR and SOAR platform. I have recently obtained my Security+ and would be excited to join the team and get more experience in this field.  

#### 3. Can you give an example of how you've used data to improve customer support operations?

- I did this at Illuminate through the data-driven strategies we implemented and the CSIT and CLW projects. I worked with the data team to define key metrics for support success. I piped those into a dashboard for viewing. I tweaked metrics. I delivered bi-monthly support retrospectives. 

#### 4. How do you stay current with the latest cyber security trends and threats?

Right now my understanding of cyber security trends and threats is mostly theoretical. I follow a number of YouTube channels. How deep i start going with it in learning and experience will depend on my next position. I would say my next steps are hack the box, let's defend, and try hack me. I'm very interested in learning by doing. I also will be upgrading my home lab to increase its capabilities for network setups and virtualization. I am also planning to start locking down and further hardening my home network. 

#### 5. How do you handle frustrated or angry customers?

Emphasize your ability to remain calm, listen actively, and communicate clearly to de-escalate situations and find solutions. Demonstrate technical expertise. 

#### 6. Explain a technical concept to a non-technical person.

Encryption

1. You write your message on a piece of paper (this is called "plaintext").
2. You put the message in a special lock box that scrambles the words into a jumbled mess (this jumbled mess is called "ciphertext")
3. You send this locked box to your friend.
4. Only your friend has the special key to unlock the box and unscramble the message back to its original form.

#### 7. Describe a complex technical issue you recently resolved.

 We recently had an issue today at a site where the applications were not displaying information. We had to scramble to determine the root cause as quickly as possible. When looking into Event Viewer, I was able to determine from logs that were receiving and transforming and documents, and they were processing correctly into one of our queue services, but the applications themselves were producing errors when trying to pull from the queue. I had to communicate across multiple teams to figure out when and if any changes were made to the queue service that would cause this disruption. I was able to determine that changes had been made to the schema of that queue. The person who tested the changes did not confirm certain fields that were changed would affect the applications. The devs had to make code changes to resolve the field changes and the applications were restored to their former functionality. 

#### 8. How would you approach improving customer satisfaction with a product?

- I would listen to the customers and develop a customer-centric model for feature development. I would keep open communication with the development team to let them know what the customer's largest pain points are and what feature they want the most. I would provide them when necessary, insight on how our customers use the software and a customer perspective on features. 
- Outside of this, I would endeavor to offer the best support for the product that I could possibly provide. That includes communication, effective issue resolution, and proper documentation. Customers should be happy with the service they are receiving. Everyone should know they are receiving good support.

#### 9. How do you ensure effective communication between the support team and other departments?

- Open communication channels are essential. Teams should be talking to each other and working together. Establishing that as a baseline is fundamental. After that, I would not wasting other department's time is extremely important. In ticket escalation, everything within the engineer's power of troubleshooting should be done before escalating to another department.  Also, it sounds silly, but being as pleasant as possible and easy to work with. People should speak well of you. 

#### 10. Why should we hire you?

- Support experience is great and vast at companies of all sizes. 
- Grit 
- Very team-oriented and a team player. Able to work well and get along people all over the world and from all walks of life. Skilled in conflict resolution.
- I have seen it all.
- Technically minded and always learning. 
- I do a great job, I'm looking for a place where I can shine. 

## Why are you interested in this position? 

- I have become increasingly interested in cyber security and am pursuing a govtech position. That is why I got my Security+.
- Red Canary would be an exciting opportunity to get hands-on experience and learning in this space. 
- Red Canary is at an exciting time in its growth. I would love to work for a company that is successful and has exciting growth opportunities.
