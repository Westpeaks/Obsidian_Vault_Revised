## Security Governance Principles

### Least Privilege and Need to Know

- **Least Privilege** - Minimum necessary access. Users only get what they need. 
- **Need to Know** - Even if you have access, don't access the information unless you need to know. 
### Non Repudiation

- A user cannot deny performing a certain action. 

### Subject and Object

- **Subject** - (Active) most often, these are users. They can also be programs. Subject manipulates objects. 
- **Objects** - Any passive data. Can be physical and data.
