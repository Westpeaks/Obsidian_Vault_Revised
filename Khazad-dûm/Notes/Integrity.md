## Integrity

### Threats:

- Alterations of data.
- Code injections. 
- Encryption attacks (cryptanalysis)

### Methods of Mitigation:

- Cryptography
- Check sums
- Message Digests, also known as hashing (**Ex.** MD5, SHA1, SHA2)
- Digital Signatures (effective for non repudiation)
- Access Control - less access = less mistakes and tampering
