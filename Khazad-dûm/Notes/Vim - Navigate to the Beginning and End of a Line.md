## Navigate to the Beginning of a Line

In Vim, you can navigate to the beginning of a line by pressing `0` in normal mode, which moves the cursor to the first character of the line. Alternatively, you can use `^` to move the cursor to the first non-blank character in the line. If you are in insert mode and want to quickly jump to the beginning of the line, you can press `I` which will place you in insert mode at the beginning of the line.

## Navigate to the End of a Line

In Vim, you can navigate to the end of a line by pressing the `$` key in normal mode. If you want to go to the end of the line and switch to insert mode, you can press `A` which will place the cursor after the last character of the line.
