# Interview Fed Reserve KC

## Tell me about yourself:

I'm an accomplished Support Engineer and Manager with over 8 years of experience in the SaaS and web application domains. Within the support domain, I have l leaned into its more technical aspects and delivered exceptional customer service at a high standard. 

In my current role as a Support Manager and Junior Site Reliability Engineer at Softek Illuminate, I've been instrumental in improving our support operations. I've increased developer productivity and raised our CSAT rating. I have been responsible for building the support department from the ground up and implementing data-driven strategies. Automation has been a key focus in the development of these support practices within the organization.  

Previously, at Zoom, my key points that would relate to this position would be my experience working in the Zoom app marketplace, where I supported hundreds of application integrations with the Zoom communications platform. This included an integration with Salesforce and Hubspot. I also played a key role in developer support, troubleshooting code and integration configurations for major clients.

My experience at Onspring Technologies allowed me to work closely with QA, UX/UI, and Product teams, contributing to product development and quality assurance. I developed API integrations and a Python API library, showcasing my technical skills. I also provided support for a scripting engine that received javascript as an input. This was essentially an automation scripting engine. 

I'm proficient in Python, JavaScript, REST APIs, SSO, and SQL. I have experience in system and database management, including work with PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Linux environments. 

I have a strong technical ability, a propensity for continuous learning, and a broad and unique experience in supporting clients from all over the world.
