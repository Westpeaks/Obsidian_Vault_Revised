## Evidence

### Types of Evidence

- **Real Evidence:** Tangible and physical in IT. (**Ex.** hard drives, USBs (not the data but the objects))
- **Direct Evidence:** Testimony from witnesses first hand. 
- **Circumstantial Evidence:** Evidence to support circumstances. 
- **Corroborative Evidence:** Supports facts or elements of the case; not facts on their own. 

### Best Evidence Rule

- Courts will always prefer the best evidence possible. This should always be the best mixture evidence with physical evidence being the best.
### Secondary Evidence

- Common in IT cases as logs and documents from systems are considered secondary.

### Evidence Integrity

- It is paramount that any evidence must maintain integrity. Must be copied and handled with the utmost care.
- This includes maintaining a chain of custody and limiting the number of people who can tamper with it. 

### Reasonable Searches 

- Evidence must also be obtained legally. Employees must be aware of monitoring. The court will determine legality. 
- **Entrapment and Enticement** - people cannot be entrapped to commit a crime they did not intend to commit. Motive to commit crime must be present (**Ex.** Honeypots).
