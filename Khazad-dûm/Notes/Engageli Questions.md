Clarification:
I wanted to clarify some of the questions asked in our interview regarding networking. I apologize if I did not provide the appropriate clarity in my initial response. I do not have textbook experience of networking principles. That is something that I realized and have been working to address. I am currently studying networking in my everyday learning to resolve knowledge gaps in that area. 
I have had years of experience working support tickets involving networks, either as part of (or primarily the root cause of) issues. In particular, I have worked to resolve cases dealing with issues related to IPs, ports, and firewalls. During my time at Zoom, I also troubleshot and researched many issues involving network traffic during meetings, analyzing device connections and packet loss. In your question regarding HTTP vs HTTPS, I forgot to mention that the reason why HTTPS is more secure than HTTP is because it is encrypted.
