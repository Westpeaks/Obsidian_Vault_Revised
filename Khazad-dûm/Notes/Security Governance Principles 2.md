## Security Governance Principles

### Governance vs. Management

- **Governance** - This is what C-level executives do. 
	- Stakeholder's needs, conditions, and options are evaluated to define:
		- Balanced and agreed upon objectives.
		- Setting objectives through prioritization and decisions. 
		- monitoring performance and compliance to assess the set objectives. 
		  
- **Management** - This is what you do. 
	- Plans, builds, runs, and monitors activity to align with the objectives.
	- Assesses risk tolerance as part of that balance and process. 

### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Security Management and Organization Structure

- **Bottom-Up** - It security ruins everything and is seen as constantly getting in the way. This often changes when a breach happens. 
- **Top-Down** - IT leadership synergies with IT security. They lead and set the direction. This is the ideal for the exam. 

### C-Level Executives = Ultimately Liable

- CEO, CIO, CTO, CSO, CISO, and CFO.
