## Confidentiality

### Threats:

- Attacks on Encryption.
- Social Engineering
- Key loggers cameras, Stegenography.
- IoT Devices -  the growing number of connected devices we have now pose the threat of infiltration. They can be accessed though backdoors and provide access to other systems.  

### Methods of Mitigation:

- Encryption for data at rest (**Ex.** AES256), full disk encryption.
- Secure transport protocols for data in motion. (**Ex.** SSL, TLS, IPSEC)
- Best practices for data in use - clean desk, awareness of social engineering, PC Locking. 
- Strong passwords, MFA, masking, access control, least privilege.
