Designed by educators and built from the ground up for teaching and learning, Engageli is designed to be used in educational settings by faculty and learners in all teaching modalities (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous, blended, hyflex, etc.). Active and collaborative learning features such as group work, learner participation, and fluid movement of learners in groups are built into the platform. Additionally, Engageli offers features to accommodate blended classes, with learners online and in the physical classroom. Engageli provides concurrent access for hundreds of learners.  
  
Engageli starts with a classroom concept (supporting class sizes from a few learners up to hundreds), with learners clustered together in smaller groups at tables. The tables have between two and 10 learners each; seating is either assigned by the instructor or learners self-select one to join. Learners can be addressed in a single class and seen as one large group (gallery view), similar to a face-to-face classroom setting.
