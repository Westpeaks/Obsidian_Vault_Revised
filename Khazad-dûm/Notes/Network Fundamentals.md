1. **Network:** A collection of devices that are interconnected. 
2. **Nodes:** The connected devices. Each node has a unique identifier, such as an IP or MAC address. 
3. **Communication Protocols:** These protocols define the rules for communication between the devices on a network. Ex. TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SNMP.
4. **Network Topologies:** The physical or local arrangement of nodes on a network. 
	- Star: central device. (switch or hub)
	- Bus: nodes connected to a backbone (single cable)
	- Mesh: nodes interconnected with multiple redundant paths, provide tolerance and redundancy. 
5. **Network Devices:**
	- Router: network device that routes packets between different networks. It operates at the network layer (3) of the OSI model. 
	- Switch: a network device that connects devices within the same network and forwards data packets based on MAC addresses. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
	- Hub: a basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a network. Hubs do not perform packet filtering and broadcast data to all connected devices.  
	- Firewall: Network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules. The protection of the network. 
6. **IP Addressing:** 
	- An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network. It is used to identify and locate devices in a network.
    - IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers represented in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers represented in hexadecimal notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **Subnetting and CIDR**: Subnetting is the process of dividing a single IP network into multiple smaller subnetworks (subnets). CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is used to specify the network prefix length (subnet mask) in IP addresses.
    
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
    - DNS is a distributed system that translates human-readable domain names (such as google.com) into IP addresses.
    - It allows users to access resources on the Internet using domain names instead of IP addresses.
    
- **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)**:
    - The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.
    - Each layer in the OSI model provides specific functions and interacts with adjacent layers to facilitate communication between devices on a network.
