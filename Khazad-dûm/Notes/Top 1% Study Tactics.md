## 5 Major Categories 

Five major categories define top 1% study habits. 

1. The blurting method
2. Organizing notes. Currently the way I am doing this is with the Zettlekasten method and mind mapping. 
3. Be proactive. Effective learning is a marathon. It takes time. Be patient. 
4. Use external sources. Using multiple sources for learning will widen your scope of the subject and give you a better and broader knowledge. 
5. Health is wealth. Take care of your body and get good rest.
