The `-S` option in `pacman` stands for sync. It synchronizes packages by downloading and installing them from official repos. It is the same for `yay`. 

## Variations

`pacman -Sy`: Updates the local package database and installs the package. 

`pacman -Syu`: Updates the system by refreshing the database for all packages and upgrades outdated ones.
