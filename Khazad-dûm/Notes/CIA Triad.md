## Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

### The CIA Triad

#### Confidentiality

- This is what most people think IT Security is. 
- We keep our data secret.
- We ensure no one unauthorized and access the data. 

#### Integrity

- How we protect against modifications of the data and the systems.
- We ensure that the data has not been altered. 

#### Availability

- We ensure that data can be access by the appropriate party. 
- We ensure that the data can be accessed when it is needed. 

### CIA Effectiveness

- Finding the right mix of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability is a balancing act. 
- Finding the right mix is essential to your organizations IT needs.
	- Too much Confidentiality and the Availability can suffer. 
	- Too much Integrity and the Availability can suffer.
	- Too much Availability and both of the other elements can suffer. 
- The opposite of these are Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction.
