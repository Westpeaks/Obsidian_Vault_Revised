# What is Agile?

**Agile** is a set of ideas, frameworks, and tools to help you manage work more efficiently. 

The agile ideas encourage you to:
- Be flexible
- Communicate often with stakeholders
- Ship work in short increments, this also includes indentifying increments with the largest payoff first. 
- Always be learning
  
**Essentially** this is the paradigm for most software deployment in the modern market. 

Being agile allows your team to **prioritize the most critical work** and **get it done efficiently,** ultimately **delivering** **value to customers more quickly.**
