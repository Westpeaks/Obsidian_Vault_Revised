# Interview Fed Res Cheat Sheet

## Tell me about yourself:

I'm an accomplished Support Engineer and Manager with over 8 years of experience in the SaaS and web application domains. Within the support domain, I have l leaned into its more technical aspects and delivered exceptional customer service at a high standard. 

In my current role as a Support Manager and Junior Site Reliability Engineer at Softek Illuminate, I've been instrumental in improving our support operations. I've increased developer productivity and raised our CSAT rating. I have been responsible for building the support department from the ground up and implementing data-driven strategies. Automation has been a key focus in the development of these support practices within the organization.  

Previously, at Zoom, my key points that would relate to this position would be my experience working in the Zoom app marketplace, where I supported hundreds of application integrations with the Zoom communications platform. This included an integration with Salesforce and Hubspot. I also played a key role in developer support, troubleshooting code and integration configurations for major clients.

My experience at Onspring Technologies allowed me to work closely with QA, UX/UI, and Product teams, contributing to product development and quality assurance. I developed API integrations and a Python API library, showcasing my technical skills. I also provided support for a scripting engine that received javascript as an input. This was essentially an automation scripting engine. 

I'm proficient in Python, JavaScript, REST APIs, SSO, and SQL. I have experience in system and database management, including work with PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Linux environments. 

I have a strong technical ability, a propensity for continuous learning, and a broad and unique experience in supporting clients from all over the world. 

### Transferable Skills

1. **Technical Expertise:**
    
    - Your proficiency in Python, JavaScript, REST APIs, SQL, and database management directly applies to the technical requirements of the role.
    - Experience with system administration, including Linux and Windows server management, is valuable for maintaining SaaS infrastructure.
    - Knowledge of cloud platforms (Azure) and containerization (Kubernetes, Docker) is highly relevant for modern SaaS environments. I wouldn't say I have an advanced knowledge of these platforms, but have a LOT of experience in SaaS administration portals. 
    
2. **Automation and Integration:** 
    
    - At Illuminate I have facilitated the transition to Jira Support Desk. This involved setting up a bunch of automation within support desk to establish response times and ticket status. This also was further revised to help provide accurate data metrics for reporting in Tableau. 
    - At Zoom, I worked with the app marketplace involving 100 of integrations with the Zoom platform. This involved telephony, meetings configuration, and reporting statistics. I also worked with Salesforce and Hubspot integrations at this time. 
    - At Onspring, I worked with Onspring's formula engine. Onspring is a business automation software that relies an an interrelated database framework. The formula engine was essentially a scripting engine that took JavaScript as an input. This field would be used to perform simple to advanced calculations based on available data and create actions based on those calculations. I also worked on API integrations developed a Python API library. I was the go to resource in support for SSO and API related issues. 
    - Creating Python API libraries shows your capability to develop automation scripts, which is crucial for this role.
    
3. Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting:
    
    - Your track record of resolving complex technical issues across various domains (audio/video, networks, SSO, hardware) showcases your troubleshooting skills.
    - Experience in debugging and managing customer problems aligns with the Federal Reserve's need for technical issue resolution.

My background in support management, technical problem-solving, and system administration provides a strong foundation for a SaaS Technology Automation Engineer role. I have experience in automation, integration, and process improvement. Additionally, my experience with enterprise clients and complex systems makes you well-suited to handle the sophisticated technological needs of the Federal Reserve.

## Common Questions and Principles

- Customer service is about doing the best job you can do to provide assistance and make the customer happy. It is about an individual interaction. B2B support is about finding key points of contact and working with them to make the business as a whole happy and satisfied with the service you provide. These issues and relationships tend to be more complex. 
  
  I have done both in multiple roles, everything from a grandmother who doesn't know how to use a search bar to assisting IT teams in complex technical challenges and emergencies.  

#### How do you stay organized and how do you organize a team? 

- The most important thing you can do is block your schedule and remain vigilant and organized. My day is always scheduled in blocks. For instance, my morning is almost always blocked for ticket time. An hour before big meetings is usually blocked for prep. Lastly, projects are blocked for the last 1-2 hours of the day. This applies to the engineers I train. 

#### How do you handle high-pressure situations or a demanding workload without feeling overwhelmed? Share how your approach and mindset help you stay focused and maintain a positive outlook.

- I remember to stay organized and keep to the fundamentals. Great progress is made one step at a time. It is always important to step back and see a situation for what it really is. Then, you can objectively make the best choice or figure out what the best plan is. How I maintain a positive outlook is to remember what I am thankful for and to practice contentment. Thankfulness, mindfulness, and contentment are principles I live by.
