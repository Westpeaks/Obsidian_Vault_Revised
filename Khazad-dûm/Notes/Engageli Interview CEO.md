# Engageli Interview CEO

### Behavioral Questions:
    
#### Examples:

- "**Can you describe a time when you had to manage a difficult client relationship?**"
	- Issue at CMH.
	- Issue at Mayo (bad reviews) or CHOP.
		a. Mayo didn't like how we handled removing a server from their monitoring and left bad reviews on support tickets that they opened. 
		b. We wanted to maintain a good relationship with their technical team. We scheduled meetings and discussed the issue in depth, focusing on building good client relationship and report. 
		c. They ended up trusting us more. We explained the new configuration is more secure and beneficial. 
		d. Also, issue right now. Driving the resolution. Testing. Getting team buy in.  
	- Customers need to know you are taking care of them and that you are competent. This will make for a lot of issues and past treatment.
- "**Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond to support a team member or customer.**"
	- I am often advocating for customers internally. Working through difficult issues. Fighting for customer treatment. (CHOP, right now Mayo)
	- Site down. Bad data. Bi-weekly meetings.
	- Customers use tools to run a business. They are trying to work a job just like we are.  
    - **How to Answer**: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers. Clearly outline the context, your responsibilities, the actions you took, and the outcomes of those actions.
- **Why do you want to work here?**
	- I believe in the power of education. When you work in tech you look for software and orgs that makes a difference.
	- I believe in the power of remote work and education. I love my remote experience. I also identify with something that Beverly said. (democratization of education)
	- I really like the team and have been getting more excited about the prospect of working here with each interview. It seems like a great opportunity.
