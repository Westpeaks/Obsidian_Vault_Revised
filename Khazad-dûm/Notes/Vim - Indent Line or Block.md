## Indent Line or Block

In Vim, you can indent a section of code by first entering visual line mode with the `V` key, then highlighting the lines you want to indent, and pressing `>` to indent the selected lines. 

You can also use `>>` to indent the current line and the two lines below it, or provide a count before the `>` command to specify how many lines to indent. For example, `3>>` will indent the current line and the two lines below it.
