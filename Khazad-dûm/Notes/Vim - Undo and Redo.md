## Undo

In Vim, you can undo your last action by pressing the `u` command in normal mode.

## Redo

In Vim, you can use the `Ctrl + r` command to redo changes that were previously undone with the `u` command. This allows you to reverse an undo operation and restore previously reverted edits. Additionally, you can use `Ctrl + r` with a numeric prefix to redo multiple undoes at once. For example, to restore three previous changes, you would type `3Ctrl + r`.
