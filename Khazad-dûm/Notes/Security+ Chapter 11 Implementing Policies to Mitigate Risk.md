## Incident Response

### Incident Response Plan

An incident response policy defines an incident and its response procedures. Incident response procedures start with preparation to prevent incidents. Preparation helps prevent incidents. Review of the policy and response can assist in better prevention for future events. 

### Incident Response Process

The first step in incident response is preparation. Next, detection and analyzing incident effects. After identifying an incident personnel attempt to isolate the problem. Eradication follows and recovery of affected systems to normal operations. Reviewing lessons learned and updating policy helps to prevent future occurrence. 

### Understanding Digital Forensics

#### Acquisition and Preservation

When collecting data for forensic analysis, you should collect it from the most volatile to the least. The order of volatility is cache memory, RAM, swap file, hard drive data, and data stored on network systems. 

### Understanding SOAR

**Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response** (**SOAR**) platforms use internal tools to respond to low-level security threats automatically, reducing admin workload. A SOAR playbook provides a checklist of things to check during incidents. A SOAR runbook implements the playbook using tools to eradicate incidents. 

### Data Governance

Data governance is the process an org uses to manage, process, and protect data. Some data governance help ensure or improve data quality. Other methods are driven by regulations and laws. Proper data governance ensures criticality is identified.
