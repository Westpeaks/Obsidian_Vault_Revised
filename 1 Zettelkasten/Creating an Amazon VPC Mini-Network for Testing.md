## Initial Tips and Procedures:

-  Follow the instructions for creating a VPC according to this AWS documentation:
   
   [Create a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/create-vpc.html)

- This network will require the following:
	- Two subnets
	- You will need a recommended total of 32 IP addresses (VPC:10.0.0.0/27) for the subnets.
	- Make sure to set up a billing alarm if you have not. 
	- Create two EC2 instances, one for each subnet.
