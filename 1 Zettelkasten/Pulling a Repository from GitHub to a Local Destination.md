## If the repo doesn't exist locally yet (first time):
```bash
cd /path/to/where/you/want/it
git clone git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
```
This creates a new folder with the repo name.

## If the repo already exists locally (updating it):
```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
git pull origin main
```
(Replace `main` with your branch name if different)

## Quick Reference

**Clone (first time):**

- `git clone <repo-url>` - Downloads the entire repo

**Pull (updating existing repo):**

- `git pull` - Fetches and merges changes from remote
