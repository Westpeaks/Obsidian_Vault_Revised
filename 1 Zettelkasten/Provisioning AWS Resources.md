Interactions with AWS are powered by APIs. They are accessed though three primary methods:

- **The AWS web console** - this is the web portal. Point and click to add the needed resources. 
- **AWS CLI** - this is available both through the web interface and can be configured with you local CLI. You can also use services such as Terraform to communicate with and automate processes with the AWS API. 
- **AWS SDK** - this SDK can be used to provision and automate resources via your favorite programming language.
