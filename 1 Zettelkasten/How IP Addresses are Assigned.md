- IP addresses are assigned through the network in which they belong. This is typically done through a process called Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (**DHCP**).
- When a device connects, it requests an IP, the DHCP server (commonly the router) assigns an available address from a pool. This pool features a limited number of IPs. 
- The IP address assigned to the device can be either public or private. The public IP is assigned from the Internet Service Provider (**ISP**). This public IP is used to communicate externally with the larger internet. 
- The private or local IP is used to communicate on the local network. These are not visible to the internet.
- All devices on a local network can share a single public IP through a process called Network Address Translation (**NAT**). This maps the internal private IPs to the router's public one.
