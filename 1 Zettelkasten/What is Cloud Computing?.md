#AWSlearning

- Cloud computing is essentially the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
- Resources are used as needed and charges only affect what you use.
- All server and infrastructure services can now be managed and scaled online through AWS.
- Resources include servers, storage solutions, databases, networking components, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools.

## Hybrid Deployments

In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources and on-premises infrastructure work together. This approach is ideal for situations where legacy applications must remain on premises due to maintenance preferences or regulatory requirements.

- For instance, a company might choose to retain certain regulated legacy applications on-premises while using cloud services for advanced data processing and analytics.
- Multi-cloud deployments can also be considered _hybrid deployments_.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- Trade fixed expenses for variable costs
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
	- Because cloud providers can have massive amounts of purchase power, they can purchase hardware at a lower cost. These savings they will allegedly pass on to their customers.
- Stop guessing capacity. 
	- You can scale elastically as needed. 
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers.
	- Although this is a selling point, it is inherent that these costs will be passed down to the customer. 
- Go global in minutes, not months or years. 
	- This is actually an extremely persuasive point. 
	- Apps and services can be deployed globally in minutes rather than having to wait on the construction and configuration of a data center in a particular region.
