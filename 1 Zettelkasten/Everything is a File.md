In Linux, everything is represented as a file:

- Regular files (documents, scripts, programs)
- Directories
- Devices (Drives)
- Network Sockets
- Processes

This is a core philosophy of Linux taken from the original Unix framework. It means that almost everything in the system can be interacted with in the same way. 

## The Root Directory

The top of the file system is `/` referred to as root. Every other file system within the Linux system branches out from the root directory.
