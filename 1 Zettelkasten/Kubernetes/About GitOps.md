- GitOps is a set of best practices where the entire code delivery process is controlled via Git, including infrastructure and application definition as code and automation to complete updates and rollbacks.
## The Key GitOps Principles

- The entire system (infrastructure and applications) is described declaratively.
- The canonical desired system state is versioned in Git. 
- Changes are automated
- Software agents ensure correctness and alert on divergence.
