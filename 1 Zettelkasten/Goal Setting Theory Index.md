- Goals must be simple and achievable.
- Must be 100% controllable. 
- An outcome is not a goal, but goals will have outcomes (**Ex.** Landing my first job as a DevOps engineer). 

## Work is the goal

- The work to achieve the outcome is the goal. **The work is the goal.** You must do the amount of work necessary that would make it unreasonable for the outcome not to happen. 
- The goal must be measurable. A proper goal is timed work to achieve the goal. (**Ex.** I am going to study two hours a day to get and AWS practitioner certification). 
- Boil everything down to behavior. 

## A Goal Should Be:

1. Measurable
2. Sense of accomplish during the journey
3. Detached from results
