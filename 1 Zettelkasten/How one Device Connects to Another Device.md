- Devices on a network connect to each other using a variety of methods: wired connections, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and infrared. This depends on each device and its capabilities. 
- Once connected, devices on the same network use protocols such as Address Resolution Protocol (**ARP**) for IPv4 and Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (**NDP**) for IPv6. 
- When devices send data back and forth, they consolidate the data into packets. These packets include both source and destination IPs and MAC addresses. A network switch will use this data to route where the packets/data will be routed.
- For devices on separate networks, a router is required. 
- Routers use the destination IP address to determine the correct path. Routers are also involved in routing devices within the same network. This is done through routing tables and rules
